## Background
The history of the Near East has been characterised by cycles of growth and collapse. Though periods of political and social centralization were interspersed with periods of fragmentation, the overall trend was an evolution from city-states into larger, more complex political entities [@liverani_historical_2005]. The transition from Bronze Age to Iron Age that unravelled around 1200 BC culminated in the emergence of successive Large Territorial Empires. Consequently, the long list of empires inaugurated by the Neo-Assyrians dominated the region from about the 9th century BC until the early 20th century. This period of upheaval witnessed profound social, political, economic and cultural changes. The level of urbanisation declined, trade was disrupted, and invaders appeared. Although causes of these events are not fully understood, they have been attributed to social revolution, ecological disaster, and large-scale migrations, amongst other factors [@mieroop_history_2015]. Yet, the distinction between consequences and catalysts remains ambiguous. Moreover, archaeology still struggles to explain the underlying mechanisms of accompanying changes in landscape organization in Northern Mesopotamia and the Levant. The tell-dominated landscape of the Bronze Age was reshaped and the nucleated centres were superseded by smaller, rural settlements and occasional large cities. This structural change in settlement pattern was termed ‘The Great Dispersal’ [@wilkinson_archaeological_2003]. The new arrangement of space endured until the late Islamic period.

## Previous work

Importantly, the transformation was uneven across space and time. The rain-fed steppes of Upper Mesopotamia saw the settlement dispersal in the Late Bronze Age. In contrast, the change in the Northern Levant did not occur until the Hellenistic and Roman-Byzantine periods. Therefore, the roots of the changes could differ across regions and might result from various overlapping factors. There is a definite correlation between centralization of political entities and the consequent emergence of empires in Jazira. The dispersal pattern has been attributed to political activities, such as administrative restructuring [@wilkinson_regional_2000], creation of a ‘landscape of power’ [@bonacossi_landscapes_1996], and institutional colonization [@wilkinson_landscape_2005]. In Jazira, the conquered population was forcibly translocated by the Neo-Assyrian state, while in the Levant a few centuries later, Rome was exercising its power and changing the local landscape by granting land to army veterans [@giorgi_formation_2007]. 

Besides organized resettlements, the movement of indigenous population or nomadic peoples may have played a role in shaping new pattern. Most recent studies emphasize mobility and the dynamics of movement as a major factor enabling social transition that led to new settlement patterns [@altaweel_revolutionizing_2018]. On the economic level, it has been argued that increases in settlement density were related to the commercialization of agriculture [@wilkinson_nucleation_2004]. The demand for farming products in new large administrative centres may have resulted in the reorganization of the agricultural hinterland. This would explain the foundation of new villages, farmhouses or hamlets, as well as the creation of large irrigation projects [@wilkinson_landscape_2005]. Additionally, changes from community to private land ownership accompanied the development of a market economy linked to long-distance trade [@casana_structural_2007]. These processes that transformed the countryside in the Near East may have analogies in the Roman Empire, where stable political conditions were vital for the development of the Roman villa [@altaweel_revolutionizing_2018]. 

Thus, it is clear that the circumstances of settlement dispersal are difficult to explain by a single framework. One reason for this is the aforementioned variation across time and space, causing doubt as to whether these events are even interrelated. There is also a gap in understanding of rural settlements due to a lack of excavations and a general bias towards large sites. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive inter-regional study of rural settlement patterns, which would serve as a benchmark for further research avenues.

## Research Questions

* What is the timing of the ‘Great Dispersal’ across the Northern Fertile Crescent?  
* Was there one dispersal or many ‘dispersals’? Are these events interrelated?  
* What are the processes underpinning the change?  
* What are the long-term settlement trajectories in the Northern Fertile Crescent from the Iron Age to       the Late Islamic period? 

## Research Objectives

The purposes of this study are twofold. Firstly, it aims to better understand the timing and mechanisms underlying 'The Great Dispersal' process and the consequent long-term occupation of the landscape under the rule of Later Territorial Empires in the Fertile Crescent. Secondly, it aims to develop transparent, reproducible and open workflows for analysing and visualizing archaeological survey data, dealing with so called ‘big data’ in archaeology.

In order to address the first objective, I aim to provide new insights into spatial and diachronic settlement trajectories in relation to:

* The ecological landscape - by looking at correlations between variables standardized across the region,    such us geomorphology, climate or vegetation.  

* The socio-political landscape - by detecting settlement patterns, hierarchy and distribution, as well      as their relationships with administrative structures.

* The economic landscape - by following the shifts in land tenure practices under state development from     subsistence economy to commercial farming.

I shall meet the second objective by harnessing cutting edge developments in Spatial Data Science. I will design reproducible workflows for dealing with archaeological survey data. I will address data management practices, the limitations of legacy-surveys, border edge issues, and artefact distribution patterns.

## Data

This study will build upon datasets collected by the 'Fragile Crescent' project, covering the northern part of the Fertile Crescent. The area encompasses the Levant and Northern Mesopotamia. The database comprises legacy archaeological surveys, topographical maps, historical geographies, and satellite imagery brought into one analytical framework [@lawrence_chronology_2012].  Although the project itself has ended, the database is still updated and is one of the largest academic collections of archaeological sites in the Near East. As part of my project, I will revise the current data model and database software and consider additional datasets and enhancements.

## Methodology

*‘The question then becomes how best to mine, mix and otherwise analyse a potential embarrassment of riches’* [@bevan_data_2015 p.4]

To answer my research question, I propose to use a selection of qualitative and quantitative methods. In doing so, I will answer a recent call to carry out an open science in archaeology built on three pillars: open access, open methods and open data [@marwick_open_2017]. I propose to employ methodological developments of movement known as Spatial or Geographic Data Science. These are seen as part of a wider Data Science paradigm, though with a spatial component added to data analysis, statistics, data mining, and machine learning database manipulation [@anselin_spatial_2015]. This approach also emphasises  command-line interface and reproducibility [@singleton_establishing_2016]. Hence, this project will prove state of the art in coupling R language and GIS software. R is a versatile statistical language that provides an environment for data manipulation, analysis, modelling and visualisation. It also provides an ability to move seamlessly from analysis of spatial to non-spatial data [@muenchow_geocomputation_2018].

## Importance of Research

In sum, the innovative nature of this study means that it will:  

* analyse the largest database of archaeological sites in the Near East  
* research ‘The Great Dispersal’, one of the most puzzling processes in ancient history  
* present a model of settlement trajectories, with an emphasis on poorly understood rural settlements in     the  Northern Fertile Crescent  
* design open and reproducible procedures to analyze legacy archaeological datasets
  conduct cutting edge, internet-based research  

## Dissemination

I plan to communicate my work and the results of my research in the following manner:  

* Phd thesis, journal articles, conference presentations, posters  
* An online book or blog to serve as a ‘technical paper’ to document and discuss methodology  
* An online code repository to share and receive feedback on code and analysis  
* Web mapping to visualize selected themes of analysis  
* Workshops to share good practice of working with open source software
