<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The history of the Near East has been characterised by cycles of growth and collapse. Though periods of political and social centralization were interspersed with periods of fragmentation, the overall trend was an evolution from city-states into larger, more complex political entities <span class="citation" data-cites="liverani_historical_2005">(Liverani <a href="#ref-liverani_historical_2005">2005</a>)</span>. The transition from Bronze Age to Iron Age that unravelled around 1200 BC culminated in the emergence of successive Large Territorial Empires. Consequently, the long list of empires inaugurated by the Neo-Assyrians dominated the region from about the 9th century BC until the early 20th century. This period of upheaval witnessed profound social, political, economic and cultural changes. The level of urbanisation declined, trade was disrupted, and invaders appeared. Although causes of these events are not fully understood, they have been attributed to social revolution, ecological disaster, and large-scale migrations, amongst other factors <span class="citation" data-cites="mieroop_history_2015">(Mieroop <a href="#ref-mieroop_history_2015">2015</a>)</span>. Yet, the distinction between consequences and catalysts remains ambiguous. Moreover, archaeology still struggles to explain the underlying mechanisms of accompanying changes in landscape organization in Northern Mesopotamia and the Levant. The tell-dominated landscape of the Bronze Age was reshaped and the nucleated centres were superseded by smaller, rural settlements and occasional large cities. This structural change in settlement pattern was termed ‘The Great Dispersal’ <span class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson_archaeological_2003">(Wilkinson <a href="#ref-wilkinson_archaeological_2003">2003</a>)</span>. The new arrangement of space endured until the late Islamic period.</p>

<p>Importantly, the transformation was uneven across space and time. The rain-fed steppes of Upper Mesopotamia saw the settlement dispersal in the Late Bronze Age. In contrast, the change in the Northern Levant did not occur until the Hellenistic and Roman-Byzantine periods. Therefore, the roots of the changes could differ across regions and might result from various overlapping factors. There is a definite correlation between centralization of political entities and the consequent emergence of empires in Jazira. The dispersal pattern has been attributed to political activities, such as administrative restructuring <span class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson_regional_2000">(Wilkinson <a href="#ref-wilkinson_regional_2000">2000</a>)</span>, creation of a ‘landscape of power’ <span class="citation" data-cites="bonacossi_landscapes_1996">(Bonacossi <a href="#ref-bonacossi_landscapes_1996">1996</a>)</span>, and institutional colonization <span class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson_landscape_2005">(Wilkinson et al. <a href="#ref-wilkinson_landscape_2005">2005</a>)</span>. In Jazira, the conquered population was forcibly translocated by the Neo-Assyrian state, while in the Levant a few centuries later, Rome was exercising its power and changing the local landscape by granting land to army veterans <span class="citation" data-cites="giorgi_formation_2007">(Giorgi <a href="#ref-giorgi_formation_2007">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Besides organized resettlements, the movement of indigenous population or nomadic peoples may have played a role in shaping new pattern. Most recent studies emphasize mobility and the dynamics of movement as a major factor enabling social transition that led to new settlement patterns <span class="citation" data-cites="altaweel_revolutionizing_2018">(Altaweel and Squitieri <a href="#ref-altaweel_revolutionizing_2018">2018</a>)</span>. On the economic level, it has been argued that increases in settlement density were related to the commercialization of agriculture <span class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson_nucleation_2004">(Wilkinson, Ur, and Casana <a href="#ref-wilkinson_nucleation_2004">2004</a>)</span>. The demand for farming products in new large administrative centres may have resulted in the reorganization of the agricultural hinterland. This would explain the foundation of new villages, farmhouses or hamlets, as well as the creation of large irrigation projects <span class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson_landscape_2005">(Wilkinson et al. <a href="#ref-wilkinson_landscape_2005">2005</a>)</span>. Additionally, changes from community to private land ownership accompanied the development of a market economy linked to long-distance trade <span class="citation" data-cites="casana_structural_2007">(Casana <a href="#ref-casana_structural_2007">2007</a>)</span>. These processes that transformed the countryside in the Near East may have analogies in the Roman Empire, where stable political conditions were vital for the development of the Roman villa <span class="citation" data-cites="altaweel_revolutionizing_2018">(Altaweel and Squitieri <a href="#ref-altaweel_revolutionizing_2018">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, it is clear that the circumstances of settlement dispersal are difficult to explain by a single framework. One reason for this is the aforementioned variation across time and space, causing doubt as to whether these events are even interrelated. There is also a gap in understanding of rural settlements due to a lack of excavations and a general bias towards large sites. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive inter-regional study of rural settlement patterns, which would serve as a benchmark for further research avenues.</p>
<h2 id="research-questions">Research Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is the timing of the ‘Great Dispersal’ across the Northern Fertile Crescent?<br />
</li>
<li>Was there one dispersal or many ‘dispersals’? Are these events interrelated?<br />
</li>
<li>What are the processes underpinning the change?<br />
</li>
<li>What are the long-term settlement trajectories in the Northern Fertile Crescent from the Iron Age to the Late Islamic period?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="research-objectives">Research Objectives</h2>
<p>The purposes of this study are twofold. Firstly, it aims to better understand the timing and mechanisms underlying ‘The Great Dispersal’ process and the consequent long-term occupation of the landscape under the rule of Later Territorial Empires in the Fertile Crescent. Secondly, it aims to develop transparent, reproducible and open workflows for analysing and visualizing archaeological survey data, dealing with so called ‘big data’ in archaeology.</p>
<p>In order to address the first objective, I aim to provide new insights into spatial and diachronic settlement trajectories in relation to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The ecological landscape - by looking at correlations between variables standardized across the region, such us geomorphology, climate or vegetation.</p></li>
<li><p>The socio-political landscape - by detecting settlement patterns, hierarchy and distribution, as well as their relationships with administrative structures.</p></li>
<li><p>The economic landscape - by following the shifts in land tenure practices under state development from subsistence economy to commercial farming.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I shall meet the second objective by harnessing cutting edge developments in Spatial Data Science. I will design reproducible workflows for dealing with archaeological survey data. I will address data management practices, the limitations of legacy-surveys, border edge issues, and artefact distribution patterns.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>This study will build upon datasets collected by the ‘Fragile Crescent’ project, covering the northern part of the Fertile Crescent. The area encompasses the Levant and Northern Mesopotamia. The database comprises legacy archaeological surveys, topographical maps, historical geographies, and satellite imagery brought into one analytical framework <span class="citation" data-cites="lawrence_chronology_2012">(Lawrence, Bradbury, and Dunford <a href="#ref-lawrence_chronology_2012">2012</a>)</span>. Although the project itself has ended, the database is still updated and is one of the largest academic collections of archaeological sites in the Near East. As part of my project, I will revise the current data model and database software and consider additional datasets and enhancements.</p>

<p>To answer my research question, I propose to use a selection of qualitative and quantitative methods. In doing so, I will answer a recent call to carry out an open science in archaeology built on three pillars: open access, open methods and open data <span class="citation" data-cites="marwick_open_2017">(Marwick <a href="#ref-marwick_open_2017">2017</a>)</span>. I propose to employ methodological developments of movement known as Spatial or Geographic Data Science. These are seen as part of a wider Data Science paradigm, though with a spatial component added to data analysis, statistics, data mining, and machine learning database manipulation <span class="citation" data-cites="anselin_spatial_2015">(Anselin <a href="#ref-anselin_spatial_2015">2015</a>)</span>. This approach also emphasises command-line interface and reproducibility <span class="citation" data-cites="singleton_establishing_2016">(Singleton, Spielman, and Brunsdon <a href="#ref-singleton_establishing_2016">2016</a>)</span>. Hence, this project will prove state of the art in coupling R language and GIS software. R is a versatile statistical language that provides an environment for data manipulation, analysis, modelling and visualisation. It also provides an ability to move seamlessly from analysis of spatial to non-spatial data <span class="citation" data-cites="muenchow_geocomputation_2018">(Muenchow, Lovelace, and Nowosad <a href="#ref-muenchow_geocomputation_2018">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

	abstract = {Interdisciplinary research with geographic information systems (GIS) can be rewarding as researchers from different disciplines have the opportunity to create something novel. GIS, though, is known to be difficult to use and learn. It is imperative for its successful use in projects that those who need to use GIS are able to learn it quickly and easily. To better support interdisciplinary research with GIS, it is necessary to understand what researchers with interdisciplinary experience wanted to use it for and how they learned it. The aim would be to advise geography educators on creating learning resources that could compliment or supplement existing learning approaches used by interdisciplinary researchers to improve the learning experience and uptake of GIS. This article explores the results from an online survey and interviews conducted between July 2014 and August 2015 with participants from the UK, the US and Europe on how interdisciplinary researchers learned GIS and which resources and platforms were utilised. Guidelines and a framework are presented, modifying the Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge framework, incorporating informal and context-based learning and GIS concepts from the Geographic Information Science and Technology Body of Knowledge. Findings show that interdisciplinary researchers want to use GIS to capture, analyse and visualise information; they largely use informal learning approaches (e.g. internet searches, watching a video, ask a more experienced person); and they predominantly use ArcGIS, QGIS and web GIS platforms. Future work suggests resources use contextually relevant learning activities and bear in mind nuances of disciplinary language.},

	abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals. Based on a presentation at the Tukey Centennial Workshop, Princeton, NJ, September 18, 2015.},

A framework is constructed to analyse mid- and long-term variation in settlement dynamics during late prehistory in northeastern Spain. Following previous proposals, an aoristic model is built with ceramic dating to feed a Monte Carlo simulation that explores the case study using a discrete time-step approach. At the same time, available radiometric dating is used to validate the accuracy of the simulation results. Departing from the static analysis of spatial variables, the model proposes a new approach by which researchers can address temporal uncertainty. The results show that patterns detected by classical spatial analysis can be produced by artefacts derived from the division of time in chronological units instead of discrete time periods. The model is also used to compare a priori identical variations whose rate of change, when analysed with this approach, is revealed to be completely different.},

	abstract = {Archaeological surveys and satellite images are used to provide insights into the structure and scale of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. When this empire attained its peak during the eighth and seventh centuries B.C., it resulted in a distinct imprint on the landscape which differs significantly from that of the Bronze Age. In the Neo-Assyrian period, capital cities attained unprecedented size, rural settlement patterns were predominantly dispersed, the scale and extent of visible route systems increased, and irrigation systems were constructed for the intensification of agriculture and for the irrigation of parks and gardens. Beyond the core region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, a distinct outer zone of the Assyrian landscape in the northwest Levant is also recognizable, in the form of tell-based settlements. This may reflect the persistence of earlier Bronze Age social organization. This paper demonstrates the contribution that landscape archaeology can make to an understanding of the development of empires, particularly when it is applied with the record derived from excavated sites and cuneiform texts.},

Introducing the idea underlying the Bayesian approach to  the statistical analysis of data and their subsequent  interpretation, the authors demonstrate the major advantage of this  approach, i.e. that it allows the incorporation of relevant prior  knowledge or beliefs into the analysis. By doing so it provides a  logical and coherent way of updating beliefs from those held before  observing the data to those held after taking the data into  account. To illustrate the power and effectiveness of mathematical  and statistical modelling within the Bayesian framework, a variety  of real case studies are presented covering areas of common  interest to archaeologists. These case studies cover applications  in areas such as radiocarbon dating, spatial analysis, provenance  studies and other dating methods. Background to these case studies  is provided for those readers not so familiar with the subject.  Thus, the book provides an examination of the theoretical and  practical consequences of Bayesian analysis for examining problems  in archaeology. Students of archaeology and related disciplines and  professional archaeologists will find the book an informative and  practical introduction to the subject.},

A precise chronology is paramount to informed archaeological interpretation of these events and their consequences. Recently applied chronometric hygiene protocols excluding radiocarbon dates on wood charcoal without species identification all but eliminates this chronology as it has been built for the Kingdom of Tonga, the initial islands to be settled in Polynesia. In this paper we re-examine and redevelop this chronology through application of Bayesian models to the questioned suite of radiocarbon dates, but also incorporating short-lived wood charcoal dates from archived samples and high precision U/Th dates on coral artifacts. These models provide generation level precision allowing us to track population migration from first Lapita occupation on the island of Tongatapu through Tonga’s central and northern island groups. They further illustrate an exceptionally short duration for the initial colonizing Lapita phase and a somewhat abrupt transition to ancestral Polynesian society as it is currently defined.},

	title = {Archaeological {Landscapes} of the {Near} {East}},
	abstract = {Many fundamental studies of the origins of states have built upon landscape data, but an overall study of the Near Eastern landscape itself has never been attempted. Spanning thousands of years of history, the ancient Near East presents a bewildering range of landscapes, the understanding of which can greatly enhance our ability to infer past political and social systems. 
Tony Wilkinson now shows that throughout the Holocene humans altered the Near Eastern environment so thoroughly that the land has become a human artifact, albeit one that retains the power to shape human societies. In this trailblazing book—the first to describe and explain the development of the Near Eastern landscape using archaeological data—Wilkinson identifies specific landscape signatures for various regions and periods, from the early stages of complex societies in the fifth to sixth millennium B.C. to the close of the Early Islamic period around the tenth century A.D.

From Bronze Age city-states to colonized steppes, these signature landscapes of irrigation systems, tells, and other features changed through time along with changes in social, economic, political, and environmental conditions. By weaving together the record of the human landscape with evidence of settlement, the environment, and social and economic conditions, Wilkinson provides a holistic view of the ancient Near East that complements archaeological excavations, cuneiform texts, and other conventional sources.

Through this overview, culled from thirty years' research, Wilkinson establishes a new framework for understanding the economic and physical infrastructure of the region. By describing the basic attributes of the ancient cultural landscape and placing their development within the context of a dynamic environment, he breaks new ground in landscape archaeology and offers a new context for understanding the ancient Near East.},

During the Ubaid period the density of settlement was probably higher in the rain-fed north than the irrigated south, and even during the phase of 3rd millennium B.C. urbanization, settlement densities in the north were probably equivalent to or even exceeded those in the south. Although trends in settlement were often synchronous between north and south, there was also a marked spatial variability in settlement, with declines in one area being compensated by rises elsewhere. Particularly clear was the existence of a major structural transformation from nucleated centers during the Bronze Age towards dispersed patterns of rural settlement and more extensive lower towns in the Iron Age.},

	abstract = {Based on archaeological survey evidence from the Amuq Valley (Turkey), this article explores the settlement history of the northern Levant, describing changes in the structural organization of settlement over time. While most of the earliest sites in the region are small and short-lived, beginning ca. 3000 B.C.E., settlement became concentrated at about 100 nucleated tell sites located exclusively in lowland plains and river valleys. These towns were continuously or periodically occupied through the Iron Age but were largely abandoned by the Seleucid period. At that time, the city of Antioch was founded in the Amuq Plain, and previously unoccupied highlands became densely populated by small farmsteads and villages. This phase of settlement reached a peak in late antiquity but was followed by a progressive abandonment during the Early and Middle Islamic periods. Local historical evidence, including the Middle-Late Bronze Age Alalakh texts and Late Roman writings of Libanius, sheds light on some of the social forces, such as institutions of land tenure and the organization of the agricultural economy, that likely contributed to the formation and durability of these distinctly different settlement systems. Results challenge traditional views of settlement in the northern Levant and highlight some of the most significant transformations in the organization of the cultural landscape.},

	abstract = {In archaeology, we are accustomed to investing great effort into collecting data from fieldwork, museum collections, and other sources, followed by detailed description, rigorous analysis, and in many cases ending with publication of our findings in short, highly concentrated reports or journal articles. Very often, these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers. While this traditional model of the archaeological research process has long been effective at generating new knowledge about our past, it is increasingly at odds with current norms of practice in other sciences. Often described as ‘open science’, these new norms include data stewardship instead of data ownership, transparency in the analysis process instead of secrecy, and public involvement instead of exclusion. While the concept of open science is not new in archaeology (e.g., see Lake 2012 and other papers in that volume), a less transparent model often prevails, unfortunately. We believe that there is much to be gained, both for individual researchers and for the discipline, from broader application of open science practices. In this article, we very briefly describe these practices and their benefits to researchers. We introduce the Society of American Archaeology’s Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) as a community to help archaeologists engage in and benefit from open science practices, and describe how it will facilitate the adoption of open science in archaeology.

Mounding is a characteristic property of these settlement sites, resulting from millennia of continuing settlement activity at distinguished places. So far, however, this defining feature of ancient settlements has not received much attention, or even been the subject of systematic evaluation. We propose a remote sensing approach for comprehensively mapping the pattern of human settlement at large scale and establish the largest archaeological record for a landscape in Mesopotamia, mapping about 14,000 settlement sites—spanning eight millennia—at 15-m resolution in a 23,000-km2 area in northeastern Syria. To map both low- and high-mounded places—the latter of which are often referred to as “tells”—we develop a strategy for detecting anthrosols in time series of multispectral satellite images and measure the volume of settlement sites in a digital elevation model. Using this volume as a proxy to continued occupation, we find a dependency of the long-term attractiveness of a site on local water availability, but also a strong relation to the relevance within a basin-wide exchange network that we can infer from our record and third millennium B.C. intersite routes visible on the ground until recent times. We believe it is possible to establish a nearly comprehensive map of human settlements in the fluvial plains of northern Mesopotamia and beyond, and site volume may be a key quantity to uncover long-term trends in human settlement activity from such a record.},

It still remains unclear, however, to what degree such models can effectively allow for uncertainty in the archaeological record, especially when it comes to incomplete and unevenly distributed settlement data, and how best they might incorporate artefact-scale evidence. This paper aims to address these issues, while attempting to tackle widely debated aspects of socio-political organisation and cultural interaction in the prehistoric Cretan landscape at the period immediately before and after the foundation of the first palace of Phaistos, one of the less well documented Bronze Age phases. We employ a simulation of spatial interaction inspired by approaches first developed in urban geography and combine this with regression-based predictive modelling to address the uncertainty introduced by missing settlements. We use evidence from artefact analysis partly to calibrate and partly to validate our model. We conclude that such an approach can contribute to more convincing archaeological theories about socio-political organisation, cultural affinity and regional identity by providing new evidence even in the presence of very fragmented data.},

We propose applying SIEM to understand which sites and areas would have become prominent in this period by using known archaeological sites as point data and textual evidence for calibration purposes. The model addresses to which extent general factors such as topography, transportation, or social–ecological advantages (e.g., environmental benefits, external contacts, religion) make locations attractive for trade and settlement and why some archaeological sites become more prominent than others in the period discussed. The modelling results have been checked against the observed data from archaeological survey carried out in the KT and CA in order to explain the best fits. The results show that geography and topography can explain the growth of some main urban centres. In other cases, settlement hierarchies are generally explained by different initial advantages (endogenous or exogenous) for each site. Similar patterns are evident in CA and the KT, where movement constraint is due to political landscapes fragmented into numerous competing polities. In the KT, movement is slightly more restricted than CA, suggesting that warfare intensity is higher in open plains than in hilly and mountainous landscapes. Furthermore, SIEM is demonstrated to be useful in characterizing areas of interactions on different spatial scales in CA and the KT. Overall, the results demonstrate the advantage of SIEM model to enable researchers to account for missing empirical data, to compare settlement and interaction dynamics in different regions and to explain which underlying factors are beyond the reproducible observed patterns.},

Different types of chronological definition or different degrees of temporal knowledge will suggest different kinds of spatial pattern, ultimately obscuring and restricting our interpretation of the background process, especially in cases where we are seeking a diachronic perspective. This paper addresses these problems by adopting both a probabilistic approach and a more standardised framework for diachronic analysis. First, we define the notion of temporal uncertainty and explore its analytical consequences. Second, we consider two methods by which it might be formally quantified, emphasising (a) the advantages of probability-weighted spatial analysis and (b) the comparison of alternative spatio-temporal patterns via Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally, we apply these methods to a case study that considers the distribution of Middle to Late Jomon (ca.5000–3000 BP) pithouses recorded in the Chiba New Town area of Japan.},

	abstract = {Raw counts of archaeological sites, estimates of changing settlement size and summed radiocarbon probability distributions have all become popular ways to investigate long-term regional trends in human population. Nevertheless, these three archaeological proxies have rarely been compared. This paper therefore explores the strengths and weaknesses of different kinds of archaeological evidence for population patterns, as well as how they address related issues such as taphonomic loss, chronological uncertainty and uneven sampling. Our overall substantive goal is to reconstruct demographic fluctuations in central Italy from the Late Mesolithic to the fall of the Roman Empire (7500 BC-AD 500), and with this in mind, we bring to bear an unusually detailed and extensive dataset of published central Italian archaeological surveys, consisting of some 10,971 occupation phases at 7383 different sites. The comparative results demonstrate reassuring consistency in the suggested demographic patterns, and where such patterns diverge across different proxies (e.g. Late Bronze Age/Iron Age) they often do so in useful ways that suggest changes in population structure such as site nucleation or dispersal.},

	abstract = {ConclusionsThis paper has emphasized the highly reflexive approach necessary for the correct identification and interpretation of the processes behind settlement patterns. In our opinion, the key challenges are: (i) to define a sample/study area and its levels of search intensity appropriately (correcting for or exploring “edge effects” statistically where necessary); (ii) to assess and sub-divide site size, function and date range (analysing comparable features only and/or arbitrating uncertain cases statistically); (iii) to account for the resource structure of the landscape (either by only considering environmental homogenous sub-regions or by factoring resource preferences into the significance-testing stage of analysis), and (iv) to use techniques of analysis that are sensitive to detecting patterns at different spatial scales. The latter in particular is an area increasingly well-explored in other disciplines, but as yet with minimal impact on archaeological practice. There remains some value in Clark and Evan’s nearest neighbour function for identifying relationships between sites at one scale of analysis, but it may fail to detect larger-scale patterning. More critically, the dichotomy it encourages between “nucleated” and “dispersed” is at best an overly simplistic model and, at worst, bears little relationship to the reality of settlement organization, which at different scales can show both nucleated and dispersed components. In our Kytheran case study, there is obviously further work to be done, but even with the existing dataset, we have shown that using a combination of Monte Carlo testing, frequency distributions, local density mappings and Ripley’s K-function allows a more sensitive assessment of multiscalar patters and therefore a more critical evaluation of the processes underlying settlement distributions.},

	abstract = {À la fin du IIe millénaire et au début du Ier, les processus d’interaction entre Assyriens et Araméens, dont l’importance est essentielle dans le développement de l’empire néo-assyrien, ne sont pas homogènes car ils dépendent du substrat géographique et socio-politique. La présence d’Araméens dans le haut Khabur n’est toujours pas clairement établie en raison de l’insuffisance des données issues de la culture matérielle. Le manque de sources textuelles et iconographiques limite notre perception d’éventuels changements politiques ou de la présence de nouvelles entités culturelles et nous conduit à considérer ces questions sur la base d’un nombre réduit de données archéologiques. Les fouilles stratifiées de Tell Barri offrent ainsi l’opportunité d’évaluer les changements culturels et politiques ou le niveau d’interaction entre ces deux entités distinctes en examinant les assemblages matériels. Cet article présente la séquence archéologique correspondant à la transition entre l’âge du Bronze récent et le début de l’âge du Fer avec un intérêt particulier pour les niveaux du premier âge du Fer de Tell Barri. Les données semblent indiquer que le site était habité par une même communauté assyrianisée et que si de nouveaux arrivants ou de nouveaux groupes sont arrivés et se sont installés, ils ont été absorbés et presque complètement intégrés dans la société locale., At the end of the 2nd millennium and the beginning of the 1st millennium bc, the process of the interaction between Assyrians and Aramaeans, of crucial importance for the political and cultural development of the Neo-Assyrian empire appears diversified and not homogenous, depending on regional factors of a socio-political nature and diversity in the landscape of Near East. The presence of Aramaeans in the Upper Khabur is still unclear since the material culture does not provide sufficient information. The lack of textual records and iconographic sources, limits our perception of possible political changes or the presence of new cultural entities at Tell Barri, directing us to investigate this problem based solely on evidence acquired from a limited set of archaeological data. However, the stratified excavations provide an opportunity to examine this process on a site where cultural and political changes, or the level of interaction between these two distinct identities, can be evaluated through the material assemblages. This paper intends to present the archaeological sequence corresponding to the transitional phase (Late Bronze Age–IA) with a particular focus on the Early Iron Age levels of Tell Barri. Evidence seems to suggest that the site was inhabited by a single Assyrianised community and if newcomers arrived or new groups settled, they would have been absorbed and integrated almost completely into the local society., خلاصة – لم يكن التفاعل بين الآشوريين والآراميين متجانساً \_ في نهاية الألف الثاني وبداية الأوّل \_ رغم أهمّيته في تطوّر الدولة الأشورية الحديثة، وذلك لارتباطه بالواقع الجغرافي و الإجتماعي- السياسي.لا يزال وجود الآراميين في الخابور العالي غير مثبّت علميّاً،نظراً لعدم توفّر براهين محسوسة لهذه الحضارة، كما انّ النّقص في المراجع الكتابية والإيقونوغرافيّة يحدّ من إدراكنا للتغيّرات السياسيّة أو لوجود كينونات ثقافيّة جديدة. إنّ أي تغيير سياسي أو ثقافي يمكن إدراكه من خلال عدد محدود من المعطيات الأثريّة. إنّ حفريّة الطِّباقات الاثريّة لتلّ برّي تسنح لنا تقييم التغيّرات الثقافيّة و السياسيّة، أو مستوى التفاعل بين هذين الكيانين المختلفين من خلال دراسة المعطيات الماديّة المستقاة من الحفريّات.تعرض لنا هذه المقالة المرحلة الإنتقاليّة ما بين العصر البرونزي الحديث وبداية العصر الحديدي مع إهتمام خاص بالسويّات الأولىللعصر الحديدي لتلّ برّي. تشير المعطيات إلى أنّ الموقع كان مأهولاً من جماعة طبعت بالحضارة الأشورية. وإنّ أيّ جماعات جديدة وصلت واستقرّت فيه، فهي قد اندمجت وانصهرت بالكامل مع المجتمع المحلّي.},

Textile production forms the core of the proposed model, which emphasizes how the demand for wool and associated pasture lands opened up new landscapes for agro-pastoral production and settlement.

Computational approaches, including the use of remote sensing data, allow us to analyse these changes at unprecedented geographical and temporal scales. Here we employ these techniques to examine and compare long term trends in urbanisation, population and climate records. Maximum city size is used as a proxy for the intensity of urbanisation, whilst population trends are modelled from settlement densities in nine archaeological surveys conducted over the last 30 years across the region. These two measures are then compared with atmospheric moisture levels derived from multiple proxy analyses from two locations close to the study area, Soreq Cave in Israel and Lake Van in south-eastern Turkey, as well as wider literature. The earliest urban sites emerged during a period of relatively high atmospheric moisture levels and conform to a series of size thresholds. However, after the Early Bronze Age maximum urban size and population levels increase rapidly whilst atmospheric moisture declines. We argue that although the initial phase of urbanization may have been linked to climate conditions, we can see a definitive decoupling of climate and settlement patterns after 2000 BC. We relate this phenomenon to changes in socio-economic organisation and integration in large territorial empires. The complex relationships sustaining urban growth during this later period resulted in an increase in system fragility and ultimately impacted on the sustainability of cities in the long term.},

This requires a novel archaeological approach: to use a lot of data; to accept messiness; to move from causation to correlation. Do the imperfections of archaeological data preclude this approach? Or are archaeological data perfect because they are messy and difficult to structure? Normally archaeology deals with the complexity of large datasets, fragmentary data, data from a variety of sources and disciplines, rarely in the same format or scale. If so, is archaeology ready to work more with data-driven research, to accept predictive and probabilistic techniques? Big Data inform, rather than explain, they expose patterns for archaeological interpretation, they are a resource and a tool: data mining, text mining, data visualisations, quantitative methods, image processing etc. can help us to understand complex archaeological information. Nonetheless, however seductive Big Data appear, we cannot ignore the problems, such as the risk of considering that data = truth, and intellectual property and ethical issues. Rather, we must adopt this technology with an appreciation of its power but also of its limitations.},

	abstract = {In archaeology, we are accustomed to investing great effort into collecting data from fieldwork, museum collections, and other sources, followed by detailed description, rigorous analysis, and in many cases ending with publication of our findings in short, highly concentrated reports or journal articles. Very often, these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers. While this traditional model of the archaeological research process has long been effective at generating new knowledge about our past, it is increasingly at odds with current norms of practice in other sciences. Often described as ‘open science’, these new norms include data stewardship instead of data ownership, transparency in the analysis process instead of secrecy, and public involvement instead of exclusion. While the concept of open science is not new in archaeology (e.g., see Lake 2012 and other papers in that volume), a less transparent model often prevails, unfortunately. We believe that there is much to be gained, both for individual researchers and for the discipline, from broader application of open science practices. In this article, we very briefly describe these practices and their benefits to researchers. We introduce the Society of American Archaeology’s Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) as a community to help archaeologists engage in and benefit from open science practices, and describe how it will facilitate the adoption of open science in archaeology.},

	abstract = {Modern archaeological research is confronted with a legacy of projects which stretch back
to the early 20th century. Alongside this, massive amounts of disparate data are being
generated by on-going excavation and survey. Scholars are also beginning to use satellite
imagery to interpret and re-interpret archaeological data-sets both old and new. In the
Near East this disparity is compounded by the diversity of dating schemes and interpretative
frameworks used by archaeologists studying the region. Faced with these issues,
how is it possible to combine such data into a coherent and comprehensive format, adding
value to both old and on-going research projects? The Fragile Crescent (AHRC) and Vanishing
Landscape (Leverhulme) Projects (Durham University) aim to draw together data
derived from archaeological surveys and satellite imagery analysis into a single analytical
framework. The projects have developed a methodology for understanding, analysing
and presenting disparate chronological, morphological and methodological data across
the Ancient Near East. This paper will illustrate how researchers have been able to revitalise
old data, adding value through new approaches towards archaeological sites and
landscapes via satellite imagery, remote sensing and spatial analyses. We will examine how
integrating multiple chronological systems and concepts of ‘uncertainty’ into a single
GIS/Database framework can allow for a robust and detailed multi-scalar archaeological
landscape analysis. Using case studies from the Fragile Crescent/Vanishing Landscape
Projects we will discuss how this methodology has led to new interpretations of urban
and non-urban landscapes of the Ancient Near East.},
