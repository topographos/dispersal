  The goal of this blog is to showcase scientific inquiry into one of the most puzzling phenomena in the history of the Ancient Near East, the Great Dispersal. Using spatial data science methods as well as open and reproducible workflows I want to shed light on the structural change in settlement patterns across Fertile Crescent that endured until the late Islamic period. 
  Here I will share major milestones of the research.
